    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;Established in 1998 by two guys and a handful of canoes, Wild River Rapids fell in love with the waters of the Buffalo River. And it found that the public was falling in love also.&nbsp;</p> 
	  <img src="images/homeimage.jpg" alt="overhead of a clear blue river. A number of people in kayaks float on the riverbed.">
    <p>Expanding rapidly, Wild River quickly grew to encompass kayaking, riverside camping, and soon after - whitewater rafting. For 26 years we have provided for the public, shepherding tens-of-thousands of souls safely along our 25 miles of riverfront property.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

      <p>With our services, we love to provide numerous ways for people to enjoy the outdoors - from our  rental services to our country store. Enjoy the natural wonders of the Ozarks with us! Enjoy the river alone, with friends, or with an organization, and let us guide you if you please!&nbsp;</p>
      <p>We will lead you down winding river paths and inform you about the magic of the region. It is endlessly special to natives and travelers alike. </p>

    <h2>The Ozarks&nbsp;</h2>
    <p>It may not look like it now, but the city of Ozark was once just a small settlement near the Little Red River in the Ozarks mountains.</p> <br />
	 <img src="images/cropped2.jpg" alt="scenic shot of a gentle river stream, flowing around a gathering of rocks. Autumn colored trees and leaves surround">
    <p>&nbsp;In 1838, the first government office was established and  soon it grew into a boomtown.<br />
     Today, it is a bustling hub of tourism and attractions,<br /> offering a getaway for those who love the outdoors and everything that it has to offer.</p>

	  <h2>Wildlife</h2>
    <p> The Ozarks are home to just as many species of animals and plants as people. Its unique and diverse ecosystem allows wildlife to thrive in its natural environment, which offers visitors a unique experience.&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>Take in the views from the mountaintops or observe nature up-close in the parks. No matter where you are, you will find something to appreciate. </p>

    <h2>Directions&nbsp;</h2>
    <p>For those who are unfamiliar with the region, be prepared for a mountainous drive. Keep a slow pace, check the weather, and be prepared for steep inclines</p>
	  <img src="images/map2.jpg" alt="a map of the highways in arkansas">
	  <p> Luckily for us, modern day technology will get you ALMOST to our doorstep. Follow your directions off of I-40 for 45 minutes, until you reach a road by name of Bear Pass. Proceed down Bear Pass for another 20 minutes, until you reach the corner of Cow Creek and Turkey Hollow. &nbsp;</p>
	  <img src="images/cow creek.jpg" alt="close up of an intersecting road sign. It depicts the road name of Cow Creek, and the intersecting road name of Turkey Hollow. A snowy mountain is in the background.">
	  <p> Turn left onto Cow Creek Road & you can breath easy - because you are almost home.</p>
    <p> At this point, you should be seeing some river sights along your left-hand side. Drive a quick 5 minutes uphill, until you see one last turn off onto Bend Rd. Take a deep breath and relax, becuase you are home with us.</p>
	  <p> Follow the gravel road until you see sign for parking. We will have two lots, one for over- nighters and one for day-trippers. Enjoy your stay with us!</p>
